# ArtiLink
This is the readme file for a software design project by Ishika, Delaney, and Qiyao called ArtiLink. This software is intended to allow researchers to upload a .csv file with DOI links to scholarly articles and search the web for popular media or news articles that reference those scholarly articles. This is particularly useful for scholars who are doing meta-science or who are interested in public perception and public use of scholarly research.
