In a longitudinal study, we explored whether living in a racially diverse environment with a high multiracial population was related to White individuals' endorsement of race essentialism and its downstream consequences. Endorsement of race essentialism decreased over time, and greater diversity of acquaintances over time was associated with this decrease. Race essentialism reduction also corresponded with a decrease in modern racism and social dominance orientation, and an increase in cognitive flexibility, over time. These findings are consistent with the idea that a racially diverse social context can shape endorsement of race essentialism and lead to social and cognitive benefits for White individuals.",,,,,"Pauker, Kristin/C-2453-2009; Sanchez, Diana/GSD-6690-2022","Pauker, Kristin/0000-0002-0848-5159; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1948-5506,1948-5514,,,,NOV,2018,9,8,,,,,944,952,,10.1177/1948550617731496,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1948550617731496,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000453466900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

With a sample of participants diverse in race and sexual orientation, we document that endorsers of racial essentialism were perceived as more likely to be racist and also as more likely to be sexist and heterosexist, relative to nonendorsers (Studies 1-2). As some essentialist beliefs about sexual orientation are associated with progay attitudes, another experiment parsed out dimensions of racial essentialism (i.e., natural kind and entitative beliefs) and examined differences in White sexual minorities' expectations of bias from this race-based cue. Findings indicate that both essentialism dimensions elicited identity threat with potential consequences for sexual minorities' desire to conceal their sexual orientation; thus, we broaden conceptualizations of cues that elicit identity threat while exploring nuances of the impact of perceiver identity and essentialism type.",,,,,,"Sanchez, Diana/0000-0002-8684-6183; Cipollina, Rebecca/0000-0002-8171-3883",,,,,,,,,,,,,1368-4302,1461-7188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/13684302221123928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/13684302221123928,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000871908600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is growing concern that biogeographic information exaggerates both false beliefs about racial genetic differences and, ultimately, racial bias. Across three studies (N = 1317), we find that biogeographic information impacts racial categorization and beliefs about both genetic racial essentialism (i.e., the extent to which people believe that race is genetically derived) and biological race differences. Specifically, we find people are more likely to categorize Black/White biracial targets as Black and believe that a target is more biologically different from White people (e.g., has thicker skin) as the target's percent sub-Saharan African biogeographic ancestry (ABGA) increases (Studies 1 and 2). We also find that people misrepresent BGA as race genes, such that they perceive Black/White biracial targets with more ABGA as sharing more genes with Black people, which then predicts greater Black racial categorization of the target and increased beliefs that the target is susceptible to certain physical and mental illnesses (Study 2). Notably, BGA remains a predictor of these outcomes even when people know the target's specific racial ancestry, that is, their exact number of Black grandparents (Study 2). Finally, we find that exposing people to the idea that race is genetically derived, compared to biologically derived, exaggerates beliefs that genes determine both human life (genetic essentialism) and racial categories (genetic racial essentialism; Study 3). We discuss implications for studying psychological essentialism, racial bias, and racial health disparities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-9029,1559-1816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/jasp.12932,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jasp.12932,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000866440600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Across four studies (N = 1,810), we found that multiple exposures to faces that are racially ambiguous directly lower essentialist views of race. Moreover, we found that when people consider a category that blurs the line between racial categories (i.e., biracial), they become less certain in their racial categorization, which is associated with less race essentialism, as well.

In this chapter, I suggest that attention should also be turned toward the motivational foundations of essentialism. I propose that considerations of power and group identity, but especially a need to belong, may encourage children's essentialization of social groups. Namely, from a young age, children are keen to feel members of a group, and that their membership is secure and exclusive. Essentialism is the conceptual gadget that satisfies these feelings. And to the extent that groups are defined by what they do, this motivated essentialism also impels children to be adamant about the maintenance of unique group behaviors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2407,,978-0-12-820086-5,,,,2020,59,,,,,,31,64,,10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.05.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.05.002,,,,,,,,32564795,,,,,WOS:000609245800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

S,"Mandalaywala, TM",,"Rhodes, M",,"Mandalaywala, Tara M.",,,Does essentialism lead to racial prejudice? It is not so Black and White,DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL ESSENTIALISM,Advances in Child Development and Behavior,,,,,,,,,,,"Over half a century ago, psychologists hypothesized that social essentialism, an intuitive theory comprising the beliefs that social categories reflect naturally occurring distinctions and that category members share an underlying and fundamental essence, lays the foundation for prejudice. In the intervening decades, research has shown that although essentialism sometimes leads to prejudicial beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, it does not always, sometimes even leading to decreased prejudice toward stigmatized groups. The relation between essentialism and prejudice is clearly complex, but this review proposes four questions that will help clarify how and when essentialism leads to prejudice: (1) What precisely is essentialism and how might a more nuanced understanding of its components and structure shed light on the mechanisms by which essentialist beliefs contribute to prejudice?; (2) Do essentialist beliefs orient group-based prejudice toward out-groups or toward stigmatized groups, and what are the consequences of essentialist beliefs among those with minoritized identities?; (3) Do essentialist beliefs engender group-based prejudice directly, or must essentialist beliefs interact with additional information or belief systems to lead to negative consequences?; and (4) Do essentialist beliefs lay a foundation for group-based prejudice to develop, or is essentialism strategically invoked to justify existing prejudice? By posing these questions, describing what is currently known about each, and proposing future lines of inquiry that focus on the importance of including participants from a diverse set of backgrounds and across developmental periods, this review aims to stimulate research studies best designed to fill the gaps in our knowledge. By understanding how and when essentialism contributes to prejudice, we will be better equipped to use this early-emerging, but malleable, aspect of cognition to decrease prejudice and create a more equitable society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2407,,978-0-12-820086-5,,,,2020,59,,,,,,195,245,,10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.05.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.05.007,,,,,,,,32564794,,,,,WOS:000609245800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present research examined what people think it means to be Black and White (e.g., a mixture of Black and White vs. completely Black and completely White) and whether essentialism is indeed negatively associated with such concepts. Method: We used multiple methodologies (e.g., surveys, open-ended explanations, experimental manipulations) to examine how Black, White, and Black-White perceivers conceptualized Black-White individuals (Studies 1-3) and the extent to which essentialist beliefs, both dispositional (Studies 2-3) and experimentally induced (Study 4), predicted those concepts. Results: We find that U.S. Black-White individuals most often conceptualized Black and White to mean a mixture of Black and White (Study 1), as did U.S. White individuals and U.S. Black individuals (Studies 2 and 3), and that racial essentialism-both dispositional (Studies 2 and 3) and experimentally manipulated (Study 4)-was positively associated with this conception.

This form of essentialism has important social consequences, including in the area of prosocial behavior and in the legal domain. The body of evidence reviewed here suggests that children's and adults' moral judgments depend not just on what people do but also on perceptions of who those people are, i.e., whether they are people of good or bad moral character.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2407,,978-0-12-820086-5,,,,2020,59,,,,,,165,194,,10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.05.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.05.006,,,,,,,,32564793,,,,,WOS:000609245800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet as common as they are, essentialist beliefs can give rise to adverse consequences, including stereotyping and social prejudice. In this chapter, we examine the development of social essentialism. To begin, we briefly address the evidence that these beliefs are the result of developmental processes that unfold beginning in early childhood (and not something innate that children are born with). Then, we consider the nature of those processes; specifically, how basic processes underlying conceptual development give rise to different components of essentialist beliefs. We then address how different essentialist beliefs might be integrated into a coherent essentialist view of a category, and finally into a coherent essentialist view of a domain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2407,,978-0-12-820086-5,,,,2020,59,,,,,,1,30,,10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.05.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.05.001,,,,,,,,32564791,,,,,WOS:000609245800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Study 2 used a large U.S. sample (n = 2803) to characterize individual differences in essentialistic thinking about gender. Gender essentialism was associated with endorsement of sexism, system-justifying ideologies, relatively inflexible and dispositional thinking about others, and lesser empathic concern and perspective-taking. Studies 3 and 4, using samples of 133 and 118 U.S. participants, respectively, demonstrated that gender essentialism predicts greater acceptance of existing gender disparities. Our research indicates that understanding and addressing the societal and personal impact of gender stereotyping would benefit from going beyond sexism to also considering the role of essentialistic thinking about gender.

This article reviews existing research on how people perceive, and remember mixed-race people, with attention to how these findings contribute to our understanding of racial categorization, impression formation, and intergroup relations. People categorize multiracial people according to the principles of hypodescent (Black + White = Black), the minority bias (Black + White = not White), and by adopting a novel category (Black + White = Multiracial). The particular categorization of a multiracial target depends on several factors, including availability of target information (ancestry, facial appearance), the accessibility of different racial categories, perceiver motives, and the broader cultural context. Downstream implications of these categorization processes are discussed, and future directions are highlighted.

Nonetheless, the mechanisms through which essentialist notions affect non-heterosexual individuals' understandings of sexual identity and of the gay community remains somewhat unclear. Through analysis of interviews with 29 non-heterosexual men, I find evidence of essentialist logic concerning not only origins but also race, nationality, class, and sexual identity/preference.

This may result in interracial conflicts. The current research argues that individual differences in the lay theory of race can systematically influence the degree to which people extend trust to a racial outgroup in conflict situations. The lay theory of race refers to the extent to which people believe race is a malleable social construct that can change over time (i.e., social constructionist beliefs) versus a fixed essence that differentiates people into meaningful social categories (i.e., essentialist beliefs). In our three studies, we found evidence that social constructionist (vs. essentialist) beliefs promoted interracial trust in intergroup contexts, and that this effect held regardless of whether the lay theory of race was measured (Studies 1 and 3) or manipulated (Study 2), and whether the conflict was presented in a team conflict scenario (Study 1), social dilemma (Study 2), or a face-to-face dyadic negotiation (Study 3). In addition, results revealed that the lay theory's effect on interracial trust could have critical downstream consequences in conflict, namely cooperation and mutually beneficial negotiation outcomes.

The intersectionality hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) predicts that the interaction of race and sexual orientation will influence inter-group similarity perceptions and produce unique stereotype content that is not the result of simply adding race stereotypes to sexual orientation stereotypes. The related prototypicality hypothesis (Hypothesis 2) predicts that intersectional groups will generate more perceived dissimilarity and more unique attributes when they are non-prototypical with respect to race (Black) and sexual orientation (gay). We found strong support for intersectionality (Hypothesis 1); for Hypothesis 2, the prototypicality hypothesis, support was strongest with respect to the impact of non-prototypical sexual orientation (i.e., gayness). In Study 1, the group Gay Black men was viewed as most dissimilar to the group Men, and to its constituent ingroups. In Study 2, the group Gay Black men generated the most unique stereotype content. The addition of the label gay also reduced stereotype negativity, particularly in perceptions of Black men. The results contribute to research and theory by demonstrating that the intersection of ethnic and sexual orientation stereotypes is complex and produces meaningful differences in the perception of groups.",,,,,,"Preddie, Justin/0000-0002-9370-3017; Biernat, Monica/0000-0003-1593-7050",,,,,,,,,,,,,0360-0025,1573-2762,,,,MAY,2021,84,9-10,,,,,554,573,,10.1007/s11199-020-01185-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-020-01185-3,,AUG 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000562371100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although Harris identifies as Black, her racial identity was widely scrutinized throughout the election, due to her mixed-race ancestry. Moreover, media coverage of Harris's racial identity appeared to vary based on that news outlet's political leaning and sometimes had prejudicial undertones. The current research investigated racial categorization of Harris and the role that political orientation and anti-Black prejudice might play in shaping these categorizations. Studies 1 and 2 tested the possibility that conservatives and liberals might mentally represent Harris differently, which we hypothesized would lead the two groups to differ in how they categorized her race. Contrary to our prediction, conservatives, and liberals mentally represented Harris similarly. Also surprising were the explicit racial categorization data. Conservatives labeled Harris as White more than liberals, who tended to categorize Harris as multiracial. This pattern was explained by anti-Black prejudice. Study 3 examined a potential political motivation that might explain this finding. We found that conservatives, more than liberals, judge having a non-White candidate on a Democratic ballot as an asset, which may lead conservatives to deny non-White candidates these identities.",,,,,,"Ma, Debbie/0000-0003-0585-6476",,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-7489,1530-2415,,,,DEC,2021,21,1,,,,,99,120,,10.1111/asap.12257,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asap.12257,,JUN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000667719200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Relative to White Americans, PoC are disproportionately endangered by environmental pollution. We suggest that when facing common threats, such as environmental injustice, making salient PoC-Identity (PoC-ID)-a superordinate category encompassing non-White groups-may motivate its members to collectively act. In a study with nationally representative samples of Black, Latinx, and Asian Americans (N = 1,866), we found that higher levels of PoC-ID predicted attitudes and behavioral intentions to confront environmental injustices, which were mediated by anger about environmental injustices and efficacy as PoC. Although PoC-ID consistently explained Black Americans' attitudes and behavioral intentions, its influence among Latinx and Asian Americans was moderated by self-perceived prototypicality as PoC. We discuss how these findings advance understanding of the psychological mechanisms of coalition-building among marginalized groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1948-5506,1948-5514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.94855E+16,10.1177/19485506221083818,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/19485506221083818,,MAR 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000773486000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

How Principles of Merit Shape Fairness of Demographic Decisions,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Demographic attributes (e.g., age, disability, race) frequently affect people's decisions. We provide a novel perspective as to why such discrimination persists: Meritocratic principles lead people to perceive some demographic attributes as fair to use, rather than as discriminatory. Specifically, we theorize that meritocracy requires that controllable and relevant inputs determine outcomes; as a result, perceived controllability and relevance affect the degree to which demographic attributes are perceived as fair to use. Moreover, we suggest perceived relevance outweighs controllability, such that even uncontrollable attributes can be perceived as fair criteria if perceived to be outcome relevant. In two qualitative studies, we probed how people think about demographic attributes used in selection (Studies 1a-b). We find that people refer to controllability and relevance dimensions to justify their perceptions. Further, people largely associate uncontrollable, irrelevant attributes with discrimination (race, sex), neglecting attributes they perceive as controllable and/or relevant (disability, caregiving status). Next, three surveys (Studies 2a-c) support our theorizing that perceived relevance impacts fairness perceptions more strongly than perceived controllability. In three experiments (Studies 3a-c), we provide causal evidence that relevance and controllability shape perceived fairness, which in turn affects selection behaviors, including seeking information regarding demographic attributes during hiring. Finally, Study 4 demonstrates downstream consequences: Perceived controllability, relevance, and use of demographic attributes together impact employees' psychological safety and job satisfaction. Overall, we find that principles of merit lead people to believe that even some legally protected demographic attributes are fair to use, allowing discrimination to persist.",,,,,"Phillips, L.

Reducing Homonegative Prejudice by Targeting Diverse Sexual Orientation Beliefs,ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR,,,,,,,,,,,,"We conducted an experiment to assess whether targeting multiple beliefs about sexual orientation (SO) may be more effective in reducing homonegativity than focusing only on beliefs about its biogenetic origins. Participants (116 women, 85 men) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions or a control condition. Those in the treatment conditions read essays summarizing: (1) research suggesting SO has biogenetic origins, (2) research suggesting SO is socially constructed and refuting beliefs about the discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness of SO categories; or (3) research suggesting SO is biogenetic and research suggesting SO categories are socially constructed and not necessarily discrete, homogenous, or informative. We predicted participants in the conditions that targeted multiple beliefs related to the social construction of SO, not just its biogenetic origins, would exhibit the strongest reductions in beliefs about the discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness of SO categories, and in homonegativity. We also predicted these participants would exhibit the greatest increases in support for gay and lesbian civil rights. We observed hypothesized shifts in SO beliefs across all experimental conditions. While there was a small main effect of time on homonegative prejudice, there was no main effect of condition and no changes in support for gay and lesbian civil rights. However, post hoc analyses suggested the two conditions addressing social constructionist beliefs accounted for most of the observed prejudice reduction.

We found support for this across six studies. In Studies 1-3, participants categorized targets with Black ancestry and White experiences or targets with White ancestry and Black experiences. U.S. Black Americans' (more than non-Black Americans') racial categorizations were influenced by Black ancestry (more than by White ancestry). In Study 4, we replicated this effect under extreme conditions (e.g., even when targets had Black ancestry and were phenotypically, socially, culturally, self-identified, and advantaged as White for eighty years, U.S. Black Americans categorized them as Black). In Study 5, U.S. Black Americans were more likely than U.S. White Americans to associate their racial ancestry with hardship, and individual differences in those associations predicted the extent to which U.S. Black Americans categorized the target with Black ancestry and White experiences as Black. In Study 6, participants categorized a target with Black ancestry and ancestral hardship (i.e., their ancestors were kidnapped from Africa and experienced slavery) or a target with Black ancestry and ancestral success (i.e., their ancestors immigrated from Africa and experienced upward mobility). U.S. Black Americans (unlike U.S. White Americans) were more identified with the target with ancestral hardship.
